## Hypothesis
Threat Actors are exfiltrating data and tunneling C2 commands through the DNS protocol

## Priority Explanation
DNS Tunneling has been used in Red Team attacks

## MITRE Reference(s)
Reference (links) to attack techniques from MITRE ATT&CK.

## Analytic Approach

### Analytic Approach 1 - Payload Analysis

- Strange Looking Hostnames
- Unusual DNS Request Record Type(s)
- Entropy Analysis

Traffic Analysis
- Large number of subdomains 
- Large number of connections
- Beaconing Patterns

Analytic 2 - Known DNS Tunneling Tools
- Look for file names and hashes for known DNS tools
- Look in proxy for downloading visits to known DNS Tools
